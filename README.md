# InputBlocker
A small Windows MFC GUI using the Interception driver for blocking input from HIDs.

I wrote this program a few years ago for a friend whose built-in laptop keyboard had broken and was repeatedly pressing various keys. This made it very difficult to use the computer, even using an external keyboard. Thus, I spent one night making this GUI which was effective in blocking the broken laptop keyboard's input. 

Note: Even if the device driver were disabled, it would be reinstalled upon restarting the computer so I was unable to solve the problem this way.
